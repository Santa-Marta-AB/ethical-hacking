Public scripts for Ethical Hacking - Santa Marta AB

Here you can find some scripts created by Santa Marta AB for Ethical Hacking purposes:

- <b>Expander</b>: This script generates a list of words based on variations over a single word. Variations include changing letters by numbers, adding years and symbols etc... A word of 8 letters can generate a list of 50 million words. Use: <i>php expander.php base_word</i> 
- <b>SuperExpander</b>: Extension of the expander script, with more combinations. It should be used with smaller words, as 8 letters can generate more than 500 million words. Use: <i>php superexpander.php base_word</i>
